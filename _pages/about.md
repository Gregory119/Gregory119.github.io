I'm a software engineer with several years of experience, mostly in robotics
infrastructure roles. I am now at the end of a masters in robotics program at
Worcester Polytechnic Institute, where, after building foundational knowledge
such as kinematics and dynamics, I have gained specialized skills such as motion
planning, optimal control, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. I am
currently interested in roles in robotics that involve either motion planning,
control, or AI, such as robotic manipulation, legged locomotion or autonomous
navigation.  My final capstone in the Spring of 2026 will be training
reinforcement learning policies for a quadruped to reorient large box shaped
objects.
